# teck-html-templating

Create a simple HTML template like a table or other small snippet like HTML. Jinja templating will replace the tokens
and finally insert your snippet of HTML into the base HTML page. The outcome is a standardized HTML for the Community
Support group to use as email bodies, or basic html reports.
